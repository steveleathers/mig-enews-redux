        <p>The City of Golden, Colorado needed to enhance the flood capacity of the Washington Street Bridge over Clear Creek, which runs through the town. It took the opportunity to build a dramatic new bridge, create a new creekside play area, add new recreational trails and incorporate local art, while preserving and enhancing the riparian environment. </p>
        <p>The architectural theme of the bridge celebrates Golden&rsquo;s mining history, with black structural steel, red brick and native sandstone. The bridge incorporates bike lanes and large overlooks with plenty of seating. By far the most popular public space is Clear Creek Plaza, developed by MIG. From a bridge-level park, you can slide right down to creek level (yes, you could walk down but that&rsquo;s so boring) where you&rsquo;ll find that larger-than-life native trout have come ashore to play with you. You can also jump right into the creek, cast off in an inflatable and generally get wet at one with the creek. </p>
