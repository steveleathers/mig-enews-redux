        <p>Booming Seattle&rsquo;s high land prices meant it wasn&rsquo;t possible to acquire land for a new park in Belltown, the densest urban area of the City. SvR Design found the solution by transforming a 4-block section of Bell Street into a vibrant, safe and green public space. Bell Street Park is a parkâ€”in a street setting. A subtle topographic shift raises the roadway up to the sidewalk level to create one continuous surface of shared space. </p>

        <p>Street and park materials are woven into a wall-to-wall tapestry of shared space with meandering paving, seating and planting forming a unifying circuitry. It&rsquo;s now an outdoor living room for residents, while still serving cars, buses, bicycles and emergency vehicles.  </p>

        <p>On summer weekends, buses don&rsquo;t run on the street itself, creating shared space for vendors, music and dancing, other entertainment, art shows and markets, games, food, parades, yoga, planting/gardening parties, movies at night and general mingling and running around. The neighborhood now views the street as a true community amenity.</p>

        <p>This is the first section of a planned park corridor that will eventually run all the way from South Lake Union to Elliott Bay.</p>
