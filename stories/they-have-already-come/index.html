        <p>Gresham, Oregon, density over 4,500 people per square mile. The State&rsquo;s largest city, Portland, density 2,000 people per square mile. Gresham was clearly a city in need of open space</p>

        <p>The City owned a 2-acre lawn area—with no amenities—hemmed in by a five-lane road on the south and an 8-foot high chainlink fence with barbed wire on the north. Residents of the surrounding areas east and west used the site, but most didn&rsquo;t realize there was a gem on the other side of the fence: a 10-acre Douglas fir forest complete with loop trail. Those who did, continuously cut holes in the fence to get to the forest. </p>

        <p>Why not remove the fence and create a 12-acre urban park in this underserved community? MIG worked with Friends of Nakada and the Columbia Slough Watershed Council, along with over 15 other community groups to create.</p>

        <p>There&rsquo;s no question now that the site is meant for people. It contains a large natural play area, community garden, rainwater collection systems, restrooms, picnic shelters, gathering spaces, art, native meadow grasses, a seasonal palette of drought-tolerant plants—and the forested woodland. Some of the imaginative play structures include dry creek bed that transforms in to a large sand area with climbing boulders, water pump, totem poles, carved wood canoe, longhouse, &ldquo;fishing pier,&rdquo; wood steppers, fire ring seating area that also is meant for climbing and balancing, soft elevated areas for rolling, and a quiet seating area beneath a grove of trees that transitions into the woodland.</p>

        <p>The park now encourages community members to play outside, grow and eat healthy food, celebrate the seasons, learn about plants and animals, and spend time in nature.</p>
