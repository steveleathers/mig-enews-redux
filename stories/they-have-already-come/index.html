        <p>Virtually unknown on the other side of an 8-foot high chain-link fence topped with barbed wire was a hidden gem: a 10-acre Douglas fir forest complete with loop trail.</p>

        <p>Gresham owned a 2-acre lawn area—with no amenities—hemmed in by a five-lane road on the south and the chain-link fence on the north. Residents of the surrounding areas east and west used the site, but most didn’t realize what was on the other side of the fence. Those who did continuously cut holes in the fence to get to the forest. </p>

        <p>Why not remove the fence and create a 12-acre urban park in this underserved community? MIG worked with Friends of Nadaka and the Columbia Slough Watershed Council, along with over 15 other community groups to create an urban forest park.</p>

        <p>There’s no question now that the site is meant for people. It contains a large natural play area, community garden, rainwater collection systems, restrooms, picnic shelters, gathering spaces, art, native meadow grasses, a seasonal palette of drought-tolerant plants—and the forested woodland.</p>

        <p>Some of the imaginative play structures include dry creek bed that transforms in to a large sand area with climbing boulders, water pump, totem poles, carved wood canoe, longhouse, “fishing pier,” wood steppers, fire ring seating area that also is meant for climbing and balancing, soft elevated areas for rolling, and a quiet seating area beneath a grove of trees that transitions into the woodland.</p>

        <p>The park now encourages community members to play outside, grow and eat healthy food, celebrate the seasons, learn about plants and animals, and spend time in nature. </p>
