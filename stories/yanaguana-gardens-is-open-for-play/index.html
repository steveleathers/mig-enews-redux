      <div id="main-story">
        <p>Can you imagine playing in a park with no jungle gym? Come to the just-opened Yanaguana Gardens, a dynamic 4-acre park in downtown San Antonio, named for a Payaya Indian village that used to be located there on the San Antonio River. What will you find?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A giant sandbox for both children and adults to play in</li>
            <li>Splash pad area with control buttons for kids of all ages</li>
            <li>Mosaic-covered structures, inspired by a Payaya Indian origin story, including a climbable panther made with 150 pounds of steel, 10,500 pounds of concrete, 200 pounds of mortar and grout and 150 pounds of glass beads—surrounded by a thick layer of colorful rubber play areas. (The story goes that a blue panther chased an anhinga bird, and the water drops that shook off the bird’s wings formed the San Antonio River and the lush life around it.)</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>A long bench that features the anhinga bird, and another bench has spirals and waves to represent the Blue Hole, the spring that is the source of the San Antonio River</li>
            <li>Oversized checker and chessboards, stone ping-pong and foosball tables and a Bocce Ball court.</li>
            <li>Speakers in the trees that turn the sounds of children laughing and playing into a water-like sound</li>
            <li>Illuminated steel “pup-tents” that form a camp circle, encouraging human engagement and creating a place for people to gather, discover and make-believe</li>
            <li>Light and airy play structures that form “houses” with scaled floor plan etched into the concrete slab, exterior wall sections laser cut with period wallpaper patterns and roof panels cut to mimic large shady pecan trees</li>
            <li>A psychedelic-looking mural that will be installed for a few years and then another mural will take its place</li>
            <li>Large sustainable green spaces and walking/jogging paths</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The aim throughout is to invite children to take (manageable) risks and build confidence. For example, a net play structure invites children to climb high, but has ropes to catch them if they slip.</p>

          <p>Yanaguana Gardens&rsquo; puts in one place MIG&rsquo;s expertise in play-based learning. Its dynamic educational, physical and social experiences encourage interaction, creativity, exploration, learning and fitness. According to Hemisfair, the local government organization appointed to manage and revitalize the Hemisfair area, the park&rsquo;s &rdquo;thoughtful integration of art, culture, history, and sustainability will make this environment the new world standard for innovative play.&ldquo;</p>
